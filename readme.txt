When the application starts, you will be asked to enter a skip-size and a step size (for CatMull interpolation).


Features:
- Original Grid is same size as the heightmap image (works with any image format supported by STB_IMAGE)
- The program first displays the reduced 3D mesh, but you can do CatMull Rom interpolation on each axis by pressing 'N' key
- Window size rehandling that conserves aspect ratio
- Perspective camera that pans using left/right arrow keys and or zooms in/out when using up/down arrow keys.
- Camera direction can be changed by clicking down the left mouse button and moving the mouse.
- Pressing BACKSPACE resets the camera, the 3D mesh and asks user to enter skip-size again
- The color value of each vertex is assigned in a shader depending on it's height (normalized range)
- BONUS: you can switch back and forth between the current Mesh and the original 3D Mesh by pressing 'M'

Code Structure:
- The 3D Mesh is autogenerated using triangle strips and indices as an element
- Most of the Camera functionality was moved to the Camera class and edited by me to allow camera manipulation
- Almost the entirety of the shader code provided was moved into the Shader class except for the setting of Uniforms which still needs to be done outside in the Main
- The 3D Mesh Generation and Modification (through Cat Mull Rom) code is all contained within the Terrain class.
- Textures are loaded using STB_IMAGE header file
